# Interview Questions
A collection of interview questions that I have encountered 


## General/Psuedocode

- What would a linked list class look like?

- What would a binary search tree class look like?

- Provide an example of traversing through a BST while printing the current nodes value. No specific order.

- Given a linked list, how would you access it at nth index? 

- Given an array of values which correspond to a bar graph, calculate if the bar graph could hold water if poured in the middle of the graph and if so how much?

## Javascript

- Given these javascript timer examples: https://jsfiddle.net/conneraiken/9m75sgbj/1/ https://jsfiddle.net/conneraiken/9m75sgbj/2/  - which execute first/last and why?

My guess was that the first declared exectures first if the timer delays are the same and if they are 1 ms off, the first would execute. The interviewer said I was wrong so I must be confusing the question.
 
- *FizzBuzz*: Create a function which loops through an array of 100 random numbers and log a message to the console everytime there is a multiple of 5 and a multiple of 3. If it is a multiple of 5, log "Fizz". If it is a multiple of 3, log "Buzz". If it is a multiple of both, log "FizzBuzz"
 
[Example](fizzbuzz.js)
 
- Show me how to create a class in the older style of javascript and the newer style

[Example](basic-classes.js)

- Create a function which tests if a string is a palindrome, the function should return a boolean and handle unexpected whitespace.

[Example](palindrome.js) - [Live Example](https://jsfiddle.net/conneraiken/5qfj32z0/2/)

- Create a function that reverses an array in place
